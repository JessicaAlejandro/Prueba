EnterprisePageCacheSSL
======================
Normally the Full Page Caching of Magento Enterprise doesn't work under SSL / HTTPS.
This extension overcome this limitation.

Typically e-commerce sites use HTTPS only for checkout, account page, sign-in, registration etc...
However, since Google's announcement "HTTPS as a ranking signal" on the 6th Aug 2014, we expect merchants
to start adopting HTTPS for the whole site.

This would be a major problem, especially for Magento Enterprise sites.
More details can be found on the Elastera's blog "Why Googleâ€™s advice on HTTPS will screw your Magento site"

We've encountered Devs and Ops of a merchant blaming each other at length fo the performance issues, due to the above.
We hope this will help merchants avoid a possibly a costly and frustrating issue.

Compatible
======================
